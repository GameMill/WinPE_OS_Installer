This project provides a Windows installer built on the WinPE environment.
It performs comprehensive health checks on system hard drives and facilitates OS installation via either BIOS or UEFI boot methods.
The installer supports network-based deployment by retrieving the operating system image from a remote Samba server, enabling multiple systems to install Windows simultaneously.

Compatible with Windows versions from Vista through Windows 11.
